LO3: Apply appropriate database concepts and techniques to solve given problems.

LO4: Demonstrate the application of appropriate Big Data tools for advanced analytics

Scenario:
BoltFlix is an on-demand movie company that operates all over the world via the internet.
The company has generated a huge amount of data on movie ratings over the years. They
want to write an article analysing movie ratings by the critics and audiences. The report
should also justify the budget of the movies. 
You have joined BoltFlix recently as a Junior Data Scientist. They want you to analyse movie
data for the years 2007 to 2001. Since they have never done any data analysis on the data,
they do not know exactly what they want to see or need. They have asked you to look at the
data and tell a story about the data.
Part 1: Solving Data Science Problem

Exploring the Data:
You must analyse the data very carefully by running some simple tests in R and you have set
up the following tasks, which are agreed upon by your team leader. For the following tasks,
you must write code and generate graphs (at least one graph per task).
1. Explore your dataset (using str, nrow etc.) and explain your understanding
2. How Genre impacts the budget of the movie?
3. Is there any relation between the critic rating and the budget?
4. Is there any relationship between the audience ratings and the budget?
5. Show the correlation between audience and critic ratings has evolved throughout the
years by movie genre. (Request from the CEO)
In your report, you must add the code, graphs and explanation for each of the tasks.

Advanced Analytics:
Once you have completed the above tasks, your manager gives you an extended Movie data
set. The dataset contains more columns than the previous one. Using this new data set, you
should complete the following tasks.
1. They give you the following graph as the R code is not found. You need to recreate
the graph by writing R code. You must use the Grammar of Graphics to recreate the
following graph. You must also explain your code and display the output at each step.
2. Write R code to find the trend of the Day of the week that most/least movies were
released compared to other days. (Provide graph with code in the report)
3. Identify if the profit of a movie depends on any of the features in this data set
4. Use ggplot and boxplot to identify if there is an anomaly in the data?
5. Find if there is any further insight you can find from this data set
Note: You must provide code, graphs and appropriate explanations for each of the sub-tasks.
Also, you need to copy and paste your R code in your report. Screenshots will not be
accepted.
